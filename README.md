# Tunetown

### Development
You should be able to open this project in Eclipse. Just select the root directory /TuneTown.

You'll probably also need to install the JavaFX Plugin for Eclipse. I followed the "Installing JavaFX in Eclipse" section from this tutorial: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/javafx_quick_guide.htm

### Building and Running
Right click on the "pom.xml" file on the left then "Run As" > "1 Maven Build"
Right click on "TuneTown" folder on the left then "Run As" > "1 Java Application"

If theres a popup that asks you to select the java application then click "Main - application" and then "ok".
