# Tunetown

### Development
You should be able to open this project in Eclipse. Just select the root directory /TuneTown.

You'll probably also need to install the JavaFX Plugin for Eclipse. I followed the "Installing JavaFX in Eclipse" section from this tutorial: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javafx/javafx_quick_guide.htm
